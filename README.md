# Image_Preprocesing
For Image_preprocessing file
<br>
I have worked around denoising the image and how to do so i.e by thresholding the pixel values so as to make the texts be highlighted more
<br>
the preprocessign is done for the ocr to detect with much more easiness and more accuracy
<br>
<br>
For the Rotated_image file
I have taken an intentionally rotated image and tried to get it to its original format 
<br>
For that i had to find the deskew angle which is basically the angle with the image is rotated from its orginal position
<br>
where i had to initialize x and y axis kernels and also finding all contours which in the end helped me finding the skew angle
